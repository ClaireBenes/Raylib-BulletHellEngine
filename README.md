## Features  

- **ImGui-powered editor** – Adjust/Create bullet data and bullet patterns.  
- **Customizable bullet patterns** – Modify in real-time without recompilation.  
- **Player and enemy systems** – Includes movement, hitboxes, and attack behaviors.  

## Project Structure  

- **`Bullet.cpp`** – Manages bullet movement and behavior.
- **`BulletSpawner.cpp`** – Spawns bullet and manages all the patterns.  
- **`Player.cpp`** – Implements player movement, hitboxes, and interactions.  
- **`GameManager.cpp`** – Core game loop, including rendering, updates and optimization.  
- **`ToolInterface.cpp`** – Handles the ImGui interface (Bullet, Pattern, Editor).

## Status  

This project is more of a **fun experiment** than anything serious. It's designed to explore the possibilities of bullet hell mechanics with Raylib and **ImGui**, so feel free to play around with it however you like!
