## 💡 Inspiration  

This project was inspired by the work of **Erik Bolumburu** and his [Touhou Clone Engine](https://github.com/erikbolumburu11/Touhou-Clone-Engine) who gave me the idea for the look of the project.

## 📌 Status  

This project is more of a **fun experiment** than anything serious. It's designed to explore the possibilities of bullet hell mechanics with Raylib and **ImGui**, so feel free to play around with it however you like!
